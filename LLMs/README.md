1️⃣ LangChain

* It's a framework to build applications around LLMs (Large Language Models).

What it does?

1. *Helps you orchestrate LLMs* (like OpenAI GPT, Llama, etc.) for real applications.
2. *Provides tools* for prompt management, memory, chaining calls, agent behavior, and connecting to data sources (databases, APIs, docs).
3. **Use case**: 
    - If you want to build a chatbot, 
    - RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system, 
    - or any application that uses an LLM interactively.

Think of LangChain as a glue/framework around LLMs.
